## Oregon Scientific WMR500 Driver for WeeWX

The WMR500 All-In-One Weatehr Station is a low-end weather station released by the company Oregon Scientific. 
Oregon Scientific (or IDT Technology Limited) previously provided a website and mobile app for accessing the
station and retrieving weather data.

Unfortunately, the quality of the app and the website leaves much to be desired.  As a result, I have developed
a driver to allow the WMR500 to supply data to the weather software system [WeeWX](https://weewx.com/).

To see it in action, have a look (here)[http://fw9238.cmkrnl.io/].
